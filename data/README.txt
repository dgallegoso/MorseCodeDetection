Here are a variety of videos that we used to test our data. We have scenarios that test varying numbers of lights, lighting conditions, and speed of message. 

Please note: 

The videos labeled “demo” are screen shots of our program running and translating the videos. These are to be watched, not run

There are some videos that translate a letter incorrectly. These are not issues with the program, but rather human error. We included them because showing the misspelled translation next to the transcription of when the light was on/off shows us where the subject in the video left the light on too long/not long enough.
